OAuth 2.0
#########

.. versionadded:: 0.7.0

FitTrackee provides a REST API (see `documentation <api/index.html>`__) whose
most endpoints require authentication/authorization.

To allow a third-party application to interact with API endpoints, an
`OAuth2 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749>`_ client can be created
in user settings ('apps' tab).

.. warning::
  OAuth2 endpoints requiring authentication are not accessible by third-party
  applications (`documentation <api/oauth2.html>`__), only by FitTrackee
  client (first-party application).

FitTrackee supports only `Authorization Code <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1>`_
flow (with `PKCE <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636>`_ support).
It allows to exchange an authorization code for an access token.
The client ID and secret must be sent in the POST body.
It is recommended to use PKCE to provide a better security.

Flow
~~~~

- The user creates an App (client) on FitTrackee for a third-party application.

  .. figure:: _images/oauth2-client-creation.png
   :alt: OAuth2 client creation on FitTrackee

  | After registration, the client id and secret are shown.
  | They must be stored in the 3rd-party application by the user.

- | The 3rd-party app needs to redirect to FitTrackee, in order for the user to authorize the 3rd-party app to access user data on FitTrackee.

  .. figure:: _images/oauth2-app-authorization.png
   :alt: App authorization on FitTrackee

  | The authorization URL is ``https://<FITTRACKEE_HOST>/profile/apps/authorize``.
  | The required parameters are:

  - ``client_id``: the client id displayed after registration
  - ``response_type``:  ``code``, since FitTrackee only supports Authorization Code flow.
  - ``scope``: scopes separated with space.

  | and optional parameters:

  - ``state``: unique value to prevent cross-site request forgery

  | For PKCE, the following parameters are mandatory:

  - ``code_challenge``: string generated from a code verifier
  - ``code_challenge_method``: method used to create challenge, for instance "S256"

  | Example for PKCE:
  | ``https://<FITTRACKEE_HOST>/profile/apps/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&scope=profile%3Aread+workouts%3Awrite&state=<STATE>&code_challenge=<CODE_CHALLENGE>&code_challenge_method=S256``


- | After the authorization, FitTrackee redirects to the 3rd-party app, so the 3rd-party app can get the authorization code from the redirect URL and then fetches an access token with the client id and secret (endpoint `/api/oauth/token <api/oauth2.html#post--api-oauth-token>`_).
  | Example of a redirect URL:
  | ``https://example.com/callback?code=<AUTHORIZATION_CODE>&state=<STATE>``


.. note::
  OAuth2 support is implemented with `Authlib <https://docs.authlib.org/en/latest/>`_ library.

.. warning::
  | If FitTrackee is running behind a proxy, the ``X-Forwarded-Proto`` header must be set.
  | For instance for ``nginx``:

  .. code-block::

     proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
