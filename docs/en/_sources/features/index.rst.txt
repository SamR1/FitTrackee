Features
########

| **FitTrackee** allows you to upload tracks from your outdoor activities and display some statistics.
| Workouts can be filtered and displayed on a map.
| Equipments can be associated with workouts.

If registration is enabled, multiple users can register and interact with other users (comments, likes). Workouts and comments are visible to other users according to visibility levels.

Files are stored in an upload directory (**without encryption**).

With the default configuration, `Open Street Map <https://www.openstreetmap.org>`__ is used as tile server in Workout detail and for static map generation.
