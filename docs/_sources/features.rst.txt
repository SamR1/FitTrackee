Features
########

| **FitTrackee** allows you to store and display gpx files and some statistics from your outdoor activities.
| For now, this app is kind of a single-user application. Even if several users can register, a user can only view his own workouts.

Gpx files are stored in an upload directory (without encryption).

With the default configuration, `Open Street Map <https://www.openstreetmap.org>`__ is used as tile server in Workout detail and for static map generation.
