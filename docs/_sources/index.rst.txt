FitTrackee
==========

| This web application allows you to track your outdoor activities (workouts)
  from gpx files and keep your data on your own server.
| No mobile app is developed yet, but several existing mobile apps can
  store workouts data locally and export them into a gpx file.
| Examples for Android (non-exhaustive list):
| \* `Runner Up <https://github.com/jonasoreland/runnerup>`_ (GPL v3)
| \* `ForRunners <https://gitlab.com/brvier/ForRunners>`_ (GPL v3)
| \* `OpenTracks <https://github.com/OpenTracksApp/OpenTracks>`_ (Apache License)
| \* `FitoTrack <https://codeberg.org/jannis/FitoTrack>`_ (GPL v3)

| Maps are displayed using `Open Street
  Map <https://www.openstreetmap.org>`__.
| It is also possible to add a workout without a gpx file.

| **Still under heavy development (some features may be unstable).**
| (see `issues <https://github.com/SamR1/FitTrackee/issues>`__ for more information)
